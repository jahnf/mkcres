It also supports partial updates of the \r\ngenerated C files since mkcres only updates files if the modification \r\ndate of a file changes.\r\n\r\nHere is an example JSON configuration file:\r\n\r\n    { \r\n      \"CRES\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"prefix\": \"icons/\",\r\n          \"files\": [\r\n            { \"name\": \"img/app32x32.png\" },\r\n            { \"name\": \"x.png\", \"alias\": \"img/exit.png\" }\r\n          ]\r\n        }, \r\n        {\r\n          \"prefix\": \"other_stuff/\",\r\n          \"files\": [\r\n            { \"name\": \"encryption_key_v1.pub\", \"alias\": \"key.pub\" },\r\n            { \"name\": \"lookup.sqlite\" }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nmkcres needs Python 2 version 2.7 or higher since it currently uses the argparse library.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
